# Description:	Set the color of the PM tabs on message to be the same as a highlight on channel.
#
# This script sets the color of the PM windows to the 'highlight' color, on every message received therein.
# Since a message in a PM really is equivalent in "importance" to a highlight in-channel, it makes sense to make the
# PM tabs stand out with the highlight color when you receive a PM.
